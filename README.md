# Color-Recognition-Project
This is my first image processing project which is written in Python with Raspberry Pi. The system simulates a part of the factory production line.

## Image Process

### Color quantization
Color quantization reduces the number of colors used in the image. It increases the speed of image processing.

### Image histogram
Image histogram represents the lighness of tones distribution in an image. It helps us to compare object image with each saved images.
